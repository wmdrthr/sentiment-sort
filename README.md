Design an efficient program that picks the first N among an array of numbers representing customer ratings from -5 to 5 based on sentiment . Positive or Negative Sentiments are ranked higher than median/unbiased ones. eg: -4 should be sorted higher than 3; 2 sorted higher than -1; 5 is sorted higher than 4, and -5 is sorted higher than -4, etc. The array may be of any size < 100, will be un-! sorted, and you need to pick only N. You can use any language you like.
